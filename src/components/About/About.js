        <p>Hi! I’m Desiree, an aspiring Junior Web Developer with over 15 years of Hospitality and Customer Service experience. I have a Bachelor’s Degree from Monroe College in Hospitality Management, and a Certification from the University of Central Florida in Full Stack Web Development. </p>
        
        <p>I look at coding as a puzzle. I love the process of creating the logic behinds apps and also figuring out a solution to all the problems that arise. I have learned a great deal about researching solutions, and the importance of networking when looking for help.  Currently, looking to work for a company that encourages teamwork and growth. </p>
